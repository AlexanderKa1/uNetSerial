PPP engine - Goal is a small and fast PPP engine for embedded systems.

Minimal features - PAP. (done)

Next Min feature -	DNS servers (done)
					Magic Number (zero number support)

Would be nice	-	Server Support with dish out of DNS,IP and PAP auth.

------------
Moved S-Regesters around, configurations moved to a base address of 0x20, added GPIO support,
added configurable serial port speed for emulator.

Nov 17 2003
-----------
Added the ability to accept reject of Magic numbers.

Jun 14-17 2003
--------------
Lots of bug fixes for PPP, Magic number support based on PPP_ID and PAP negotiation.
Much more that I forgot to log.


Jun 13 2003
-----------
PPP connect, and TCP are working.  Found a problem with peer closing TCP 
that has been fixed.  Command processor cleanup has begun.  Demo is close.
Still need to fix TCP retry and clean up the memory allocation, but
this shouldn't prohibit a demo.


Jun 06 2003
-----------
Haven't logged much in this file, but added UDP, ICMP ech reply, and a good
start on TCP.  Currently in the process of adding the IR command processor 
for the demo app.

-----------
PAP now works. Negotiation speed much better.  Error codes and reasonable
aborts during raise_ppp() added.  More clean up.  Backup CD at this point.

-----------
Cleanup, changed ppp_task() to raise_ppp() makes more sense.


Oct 15 2002
-----------
Worked on cleaning up the IPCP layer. Got response for IP address and DNS,
need to reply with same for my side of the connection, getting close!

Worked more, got a connection, with IP address and DNS server data through
IPCP!  Need more testing and PAP.


Oct 14 2002
-----------
Got the LCP layer up with the unix PPPD server, started working on IPCP layer.
Need to cleanup the retry timers for all layers. I think I need to go back to
co-mingiling the layer variables between modules.  Implmented Magic number of
all zeros, PFC, and ACFC; for receive.  Magic number of all zeros on transmit.


Oct 10 2002
-----------
Cleanup.


July 17 2002
------------
Worked on ahdlc, goal is to make it self contained with no dependancies outside
the module.

Made the error counters optional.


July 16 2002
------------

Started Development History.  Need to make small tight fast PPP engine.  Configurable
from basic and small to features and larger.   Target will be AVR after PC develpment
is done.  Based on some of my earlier work in 2000.
